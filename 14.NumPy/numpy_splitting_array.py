"""
Splitting NumPy Arrays
Splitting is reverse operation of Joining.

Joining merges multiple arrays into one and Splitting breaks one array into multiple.

We use array_split() for splitting arrays, we pass it the array we want to split and 
the number of splits.

Split Into Arrays
The return value of the array_split() method is a list containing each of the split as an array.
